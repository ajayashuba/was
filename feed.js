       <p >Bengaluru: Kerala’s Kochi airport has suspended all its operations till noon as rains returned to wreck more havoc in the state on Wednesday. Five people were killed so far on Wednesday, and thousands of others are being evacuated. The state has opened 33 of its dams, a first in history.

“Kochi Airport operations temporarily suspended till 18th Saturday 2pm since the inflow of water is still on a raising trend. We are working hard to drain out the storm water,” Cochin International Airport Limited said in a notice on its website. Earlier on Wednesday, the airport had stopped arrival operations from 4am to 7am as a precautionary measure. All flights to and fro from the airport have been cancelled. Passengers can also dial Kochi airport’s emergency control room numbers: 0484-3053500, 2610094

Heavy rains has been battering the state since last week. The rains increased on Tuesday night. Kerala was just limping back to normalcy facing its worst floods since 1924 in last weekend, which killed 39 and evacuated more than one lakh people into relief camps.</p>
